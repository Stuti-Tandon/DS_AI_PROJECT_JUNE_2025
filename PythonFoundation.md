# Diff bw Python 2 & 3
- Python 2:
  1. Dividing two integers with / performs floor division and returns an integer (e.g., 7/2 yields 3)
  2. Print statements that work 
     * print "Hello"
     * print("Hello")
- Python 3:
  1. Dividing two integers with / returns a float (e.g., 7/2 yields 3.5).
  2. Print statements that work 
     * print("Hello")
